@article{RA,
    abstract = {{
                Retinoic acid (RA) triggers physiological processes by activating heterodimeric transcription factors (TFs) comprising retinoic acid receptor (RARα, β, γ) and retinoid X receptor (RXRα, β, γ). How a single signal induces highly complex temporally controlled networks that ultimately orchestrate physiological processes is unclear. Using an RA-inducible differentiation model, we defined the temporal changes in the genome-wide binding patterns of RARγ and RXRα and correlated them with transcription regulation. Unexpectedly, both receptors displayed a highly dynamic binding, with different RXRα heterodimers targeting identical loci. Comparison of RARγ and RXRα co-binding at RA-regulated genes identified putative RXRα-RARγ target genes that were validated with subtype-selective agonists. Gene-regulatory decisions during differentiation were inferred from TF-target gene information and temporal gene expression. This analysis revealed six distinct co-expression paths of which RXRα-RARγ is associated with transcription activation, while Sox2 and Egr1 were predicted to regulate repression. Finally, RXRα-RARγ regulatory networks were reconstructed through integration of functional co-citations. Our analysis provides a dynamic view of RA signalling during cell differentiation, reveals RAR heterodimer dynamics and promiscuity, and predicts decisions that diversify the RA signal into distinct gene-regulatory programs.

@article{POLYPHEMUS,
    abstract = {{Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is increasingly used to map protein–chromatin interactions at global scale. The comparison of ChIP-seq profiles for RNA polymerase II (PolII) established in different biological contexts, such as specific developmental stages or specific time-points during cell differentiation, provides not only information about the presence/accumulation of PolII at transcription start sites (TSSs) but also about functional features of transcription, including PolII stalling, pausing and transcript elongation. However, annotation and normalization tools for comparative studies of multiple samples are currently missing. Here, we describe the R-package POLYPHEMUS, which integrates TSS annotation with PolII enrichment over TSSs and coding regions, and normalizes signal intensity profiles. Thereby POLYPHEMUS facilitates to extract information about global PolII action to reveal changes in the functional state of genes. We validated POLYPHEMUS using a kinetic study on retinoic acid-induced differentiation and a publicly available data set from a comparative PolII ChIP-seq profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that POLYPHEMUS corrects the data sets by normalizing for technical variation between samples and reveal the potential of the algorithm in comparing multiple data sets to infer features of transcription regulation from dynamic PolII binding profiles.}},

@article{Mapping,
	Abstract = {{
                Chromatin profiling has emerged as a powerful means of genome annotation and detection of regulatory activity. The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.

@article{MeDiChI,
	Abstract = {{Motivation:Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to a genomic tiling microarray (ChIP-Chip) is a routinely used protocol for localizing the genomic targets of DNA-binding proteins. The resolution to which binding sites in this assay can be identified is commonly considered to be limited by two factors: (a) the resolution at which the genomic targets are tiled in the microarray, and (b) the large and variable lengths of the immunoprecipitated DNA fragments. Results: We have developed a generative model of binding sites in ChIP-chip data, and an approach, MeDiChI, for efficiently and robustly learning that model from diverse data sets. We have evaluated MeDiChI's performance using simulated data, as well as on several diverse ChIP-chip data sets collected on widely different tiling array platforms for two different organisms (S. cerevisiae and H. salinarium NRC-1). We find that MeDiChI accurately predicts binding locations to a resolution greater than that of the probe spacing, even for overlapping peaks, and can increase the effective resolution of tiling array data by a factor of 5x or better. Moreover, the method's performance on simulated data provides insights into effectively optimizing the experimental design for increased binding site localization accuracy and efficacy. Availability: MeDiChI is available as an open-source R package, including all data, from http://baliga.systemsbiology.net/medichi. Contact: dreiss@systemsbiology.org}},
